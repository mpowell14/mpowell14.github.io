                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>Hello! My name is Melanie, and I'm a senior computer science major in the <a href="http://raikes.unl.edu/" target="_blank">Raikes School</a> at the <a href="http://www.unl.edu/" target="_blank">University of Nebraska-Lincoln</a>. I enjoy taking classes in everything from Human Computer Interaction and Software Engineering to Technical Communication and Leadership. In addition to school, I've spent the last 2 years working at <a href="http://www.gallup.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Gallup</a>, first as a software developer intern, and more recently as a technical project manager. When I'm not in class or at work, you can find me planning fun Harry Potter themed events for the <a href="http://hpsab.unl.edu/about" target="_blank">Honors Program Student Advisory Board</a> or practicing my Lindy circles and swing outs at <a href="https://jitterbugs.org/" target="_blank">Omaha Jitterbugs</a>.</p>

                <h3>My Experience</h3>
                <p>This summer at Gallup, I started working as a Technical Project Administrator (TPA) intern on a product team of about 40 people spread across 6 subteams. I've been working with other TPAs, software architects, and developers to gather requirements for 2 new features in <a href="https://my.gallup.com/" target="_blank">Gallup's Client Platform</a> and to document the progression of these features in <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira" target="_blank">JIRA</a>.</p>
                <p>During the previous 2 summers and school years at Gallup, I worked with <a href="http://gallupgethip.com/what-is-gallups-get-hip/" target="_blank">Gallup's Educational Taskforce High school Innovation Program (GET HIP)</a>. For 6 Saturdays in the fall and 6 in the Spring, I worked with other college intern instructors to teach basic computer science, web development, presentation, and interview skills to a group of 30-40 high school students. For the 10-15 students who made the summer program, we led them through the process of creating a web application in <a href="https://www.meteor.com/" target="_blank">Meteor</a> and helped them hone in their public speaking skills to present their work to the technology executive team at the end of the summer. I also worked as a front-end developer on a few internal applications used company-wide.</p>
                <p>In my first year of <a href="http://raikes.unl.edu/design-studio" target="_blank">Design Studio</a> last year, I was the Squad Lead and Product Manager for my team. We worked on a student management system for <a href="http://westside66.org/" target="_blank">Westside Community Schools</a>. We faced many challenges throughout the process since we were the third team to work on the system, and none of the previous developers were readily available to answer questions, but we worked through these challenges and made huge improvements by digging deep into the code and keeping in close communication with our sponsors at Westside.</p>
